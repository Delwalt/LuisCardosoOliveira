<img src="https://github.com/LuisFlavioOliveira/LuisFlavioOliveira/blob/master/b.png" style="width: 5000px" alt="Luis Flavio OLIVEIRA - software engineer, content creator and community organizer">

I'm a **Back-end Web Developer** and I'm passionate about **technolgy** and everything related to the cloud computing, especially **AWS**.

I'm also a **Lawyer** specialized in **Finance Law** and **Corporate Law**, but my heart has always been with code!

I'm currently live in **Paris** :fr: and actively participate in local and international community activities and events.
I share my love for technology through my blog in Italian <a href="https://www.emanuelebartolesi.com" target="_blank">emanuelebartolesi.com</a> and the one in English <a href="https://dev.to/kasuken" target="_blank">dev.to/kasuken</a>.
I also became Twitch Affiliate as a **live coder** and you can follow me at <a href="https://twitch.tv/kasuken" target="_blank">twitch.tv/kasuken</a> to write some code.
